    "1. Word spotting: Father, Eliza, Suyash\n",
    "2. Sentence transformation: I need, I would, I want, What related questions\n",
    "3. Examples:\n",
    "        \n",
    "4. Program:\n",
    "         a)A dictionary is created consisting of various replies associated with each keyword then algorithm will identify keywords using regular expressions and accordingly the part of the program will be executed.\n",
    "         b)Another dictionary consists of translation words.For, eg, My --> Your (1st person to 2nd person)\n",
    "5. Algorithm:\n",
    "         a)First using input function, program requests for the name.\n",
    "         b)If keywords: Bye, Exit, Quit are not given as the input then the program moves forward.(at any step)\n",
    "         c)Now the program searches for phrases/words like I need; I would, I want, crave, father,'?'\n",
    "         d)Once program receives any of the above-mentioned phrase or words, it will randomly choose the replies from the dictionary for that particular key.\n",
    "6. Additional functionality:\n",
    "         a) Random responses are stored in the dictionary\n",
    "         b) For any question, sentence not in the dictionary/Gibberish,program use responses stored and continues the conversation\n"
